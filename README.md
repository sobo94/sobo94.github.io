## The Making of Ep 07.
This project took around 4 months to make and was indeed a very nostalgic project.
I used the following tools, code and libraries:

- Flourish Studio is the main tool I use for Data Kahani.
- Google Android: services, maps and timeline. 
- Ontario GeoHub by ESRI:  for Official municipality polygon of Ontario.
- GeoJson.io by Mapbox: for coordinate information and more geojsons.
- Maputnik: A Open Source Map designing tool, was helpful to understand map zooming, its relationship
  to the coordinate system and a better understanding of placing camera/viewport for individual chapters.  
- Python Scripts: 
	1) Scripts to extract relevant Json into csv format using Pandas. 
	2) Cleaning data using Postal Codes, Timestamp, Address labels and Geolocation. 
	3) Scripts to extract relevant GeoJson polygons using the GeoPandas.
