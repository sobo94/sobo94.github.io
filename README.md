## The Making of Ep 07.
This project took around 4 months to make and was indeed a very nostalgic project.
I ended up using map related tools from almost all the promenint entities in the Mapping space.
I used the following tools, code and libraries:

- Google android services, maps and timeline. 
- Ontario GeoHub: an Esri products for Ontarios GeoJson Polygon, 
- GeoJson.io by Mapbox for coordinate information and more geojsons.
- Maputnik: A Open Source Map designing tool, was helpful to understand Map zooming, its relationship
  to the coordinate system and a better understanding of placing camera/viewport for individual chapters.  
- Python Scripts: 
	1) Scripts to extract relevant Json into csv format using Pandas. 
	2) Cleaning data using Postal Codes, Timestamp, Address labels and Geolocation. 
	3) Scripts to extract relevant GeoJson polygons using the GeoPandas.    

To my surprise all of them worked well within Flourish Studio.

## Future Projects/Ideas
- Sponser bar on the side. 
- Youtube Studio Analytics with live CSV.
- Cool Google timelines by profession: Garbage disposal truck, Bus driver, Pilots.
- A fictional, comedy Kahani.

## Todo List 
- Look into side bar or footer setup.
- Sort all the geojsons and related docs into one place.
