## Geospatial Biography
A project to map significant events of my life. The first 20 years were manually plotted while the last 10 years comes
from cell phone dataset. The biography is set to three (3) minutes and serves as a great introduction.

- Google Services: Phone, Android, Takeout, Maps and Timeline. 
- Ontario GeoHub:  For Official municipality polygon of Ontario.
- GeoJson.io:  For coordinate information and custom GeoJSON.

  to the coordinate system and a better understanding of placing camera/viewport for individual chapters.  
- Python Scripts: 
	1) Scripts to extract relevant JSON into CSV format using Pandas. 
	2) Cleaning data using Postal Codes, Timestamp, Address labels and Geolocation. 
	3) Scripts to extract relevant GeoJSON polygons using the GeoPandas.
