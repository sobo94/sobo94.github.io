## Geospatial Biography
A project to map significant events of my life. This project took some months to make and was indeed a nostalgic project.
I used the following tools, code and libraries:

- Flourish Studio: For Data Visualization and Storytelling.
- Google Services: Phone, Android, Takeout, Maps and Timeline. 
- Ontario GeoHub:  For Official municipality polygon of Ontario.
- GeoJson.io:  For coordinate information and custom GeoJSON.
- Maputnik: An Open Source Map designing tool, was helpful to understand map zooming, its relationship
  to the coordinate system and a better understanding of placing camera/viewport for individual chapters.  
- Python Scripts: 
	1) Scripts to extract relevant JSON into CSV format using Pandas. 
	2) Cleaning data using Postal Codes, Timestamp, Address labels and Geolocation. 
	3) Scripts to extract relevant GeoJSON polygons using the GeoPandas.    

- Mapped In: For Indoor Maps with wayfinding capabilities.
- Github Pages: For hosting the website with the Flourish Embed.
